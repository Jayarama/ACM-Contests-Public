Shared:
    What is your quest? I seek the grail
    What is the capital of Assyria? Nineveh
    What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
        African or European?

Exception:
    Galahad, Lancelot, and Robin only can answer the capital of Assyria
    if Arthur or Bedemir correctly answered it previously. Otherwise, they
    say "I don't know that!", and fail to cross.

    Only Bedemir and Arthur will respond "African or European?" to the airspeed
    velocity question. The other three will respond "I don't know that!" and
    fail to cross.

    When asked his favorite color, Galahad will respond with the favorite color
    of the person who successfully crossed last. If it happens to match his
    actual favorite color, he successfully crosses. If there was no previous
    party member, he gives his own color, he successfully crosses.

Failure:
    If someone gives the wrong answer, they must print "AAAHHHHHHHHH" following
    their last output. If they have remaining questions, those questions are
    skipped, and the next party member starts with their first question.


Test Cases:

    SMALL tests basic questions, dosn't deal with special cases.
    MEDIUM uses exceptions where all party members live.
    LARGE uses exceptions are usually failed.
