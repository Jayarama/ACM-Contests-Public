Another fine day in Evstonhiltockmanbeyroqueshire. As usual, you open up shop
  and ponder if your sign entitled "Birds of Evstonhiltockmanbeyroqueshire"
  might have cost less if you had set up shop somewhere else, say... Ipswich.
  One thing has been bothering you, however. Whilst enjoying a jolly good 
  stroll from your place of residence to your shop (you discounted living above
  since it was curved), you made note of a rather silly group of individuals
  walking about, searching for their friend Bruce. The group reminded you of
  a few birds sold in your brother's shop, as one of them was dressed as a
  proper penguin. That is not to say the individual was dressed in a tuxedo and
  other finery, but rather they were in a penguin suit. Indeed, quite the
  silly lot.
  
Deciding to get on with it, you note a letter was delivered to the shop,
  warning you of a sudden outbreak of stonecolditus among literally hundreds
  of bird species. Understanding this means a great many attempted returns,
  you prepare yourself for the horde of discontent customers. The guild will
  only compensate you for returned birds which have indeed bitten the dust,
  checked out, become fully and wholly defunct, or snuffed it. In other words,
  ones which are right proper dead. The problem with stonecolditus is that it
  affects the plumage, behaviour and a multitude of other aspects of birds.
  
You will need to determine not only if the bird was one which you sold, but
  also if it is deceased or just suffering in untold agony.

==============================================================================

You will be provided a series of qualifiers which describe birds you know of.
You will also be provided a list of qualifiers for each attempted return.
  
These descriptions must make sense. For example, in a world where only blue
  and red birds exist, sad though it may be, word of a green bird would be 
  unheard of. Were someone to try and return a supposedly nonexistant bird to
  your shop, you would take issue with this. All valid, mutually exclusive
  descriptors of a specific category (for example, its penchant for SPAM)
  comprise a descriptor set.

Being a frugal shop owner suffering an onslaught of questionable customer
  service claims, you have a stinginess factor. Should the questionable nature
  of the return exceed your stinginess factor, you will reject the return.
  Each oddity you note should count once against that claim. An oddity can be
  a missing descriptor, using an unacceptable descriptor in lieu of an
  acceptable one, or having an extraneous descriptor.

A RED, SCREAMING, COCONUT PARROT could be described as RSCP. A RED, SCREAMING, 
  LIME PARROT could be described as RSLP. A SLUGGISH, RED, LAMENTING, COCONUT
  PARROT could be described as SRLCP.
However, customers are largely common folk, and thusly not trained in the ways
  of SNA (Standard Name Abbreviation). You might be told that a bird is a PARROT
  who loves COCONUTs and may or may not have turned itself RED from SCREAMING
  so much, which in your haste would be written as PCRS. You should treat both
  PCRS and RSCP as equivalent descriptions.
  
Input will consist of one test case per file. On the first line will be D, the
  number of descriptor sets; N, the number of attempted returns; and S, your
  stinginess factor. On the next line are D descriptor sets. Following these
  are N descriptions of attempted returns.

Your output should consist of either the letter 'y' or 'n' depending on
  whether you accept the return or not.
