# Death Star 2 by Andrew Sosa

The backstory:

    Luke Skywalker & pals have been captured by the Death Star! Using
    their quick thinking, they've infiltrated a control room near the
    hangar. Now, they must gain access to the control computer.

The problem:

    Pairs of characters will be provided via stdin in the format of
    [x,y]. Pairs must be printed such that a given pair's first character
    matches the preceding pair's second character, and a given pair's second
    character matches the following pair's first character.

    For example:

        Input  - [[x,y], [w,x], [y,z]]
        Output - [[w,x], [x,y], [y,z]]

    Note, the final ordering of pairs must not strictly be alphabetical.
    Additionally, a single batch of input might contain multiple lines.
