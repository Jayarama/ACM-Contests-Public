# Garbage Compactor by Andrew Sosa

The backstory:

    After rescuing Princess Leia, our heroes jumped into the garbage
    chute - but now the trash compactor is active! To prevent our
    heroes from getting crushed, R2-D2 must hack into the control
    and disable it! But first, he must crack the code. 

The problem:

    Pairs of characters will be provided via stdin in the format of
    [x,y]. The n'th pair must be matched to the n+1'th where pair n's
    second character must match the n+1'th first character.

    For example:

        Input  - [x,y], [w,x], [y,z]
        Output - [w,x], [x,y], [y,z]

    Note, the final ordering of pairs must not strictly be alphabetical.
