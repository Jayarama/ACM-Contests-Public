# Death Star 2 by Andrew Sosa

The backstory:

    Luke Skywalker & pals have been captured by the Death Star! Using
    their quick thinking, they've infiltrated a control room near the
    hangar. Now, they must gain access to the control computer.

The problem:

    Pairs of characters will be provided via stdin in the format of
    [x,y]. The n'th pair must be matched to the n+1'th where pair n's
    second character must match the n+1'th first character.

    For example:

        Input  - [x,y], [w,x], [y,z]
        Output - [w,x], [x,y], [y,z]

    Note, the final ordering of pairs must not strictly be alphabetical.
