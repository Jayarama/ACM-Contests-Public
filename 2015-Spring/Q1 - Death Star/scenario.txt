# Death Star (part 1) by Andrew Sosa

The backstory:

    Luke Skywalker & pals have been captured by the Death Star! Using
    their quick thinking, they've infiltrated a control room near the
    hangar. Now, they must gain access to the control computer.

The problem:

    Numerical equations will be provided via stdin. The goal is to
    evaluate the expression and print the result to the command line.
    The expression should be evaluated from left-to-right, ignoring
    order of operations.
