# Death Star 2 by Andrew Sosa

The backstory:

    The gang has fallen into the Garbage Compactor! R2-D2 must now
    hack into the control system to shut it off!

The problem:

    Pairs of characters will be provided via stdin in the format of
    [x,y]. Pairs must be printed such that a given pair's first character
    matches the preceding pair's second character, and a given pair's second
    character matches the following pair's first character.

    For example:

        Input  - [[x,y], [w,x], [y,z]]
        Output - [[w,x], [x,y], [y,z]]

    Note, the final ordering of pairs must not strictly be alphabetical.
    Additionally, a single batch of input might contain multiple lines.
