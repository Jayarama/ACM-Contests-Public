The input will consist of a map and directions. The map will be a square
  arrangement of numbered landmarks. Each number corresponds to a specific
  landmark. The directions will be a series of triples containing a landmark L,
  a cardinal direction C, and a number N.
The task is to determine all possible locations of burried treasure. This is
  accomplished by navigating from waypoint to waypoint by following the series
  of directions based on landmarks.

The start location will be landmark 0. The next landmark will be in a cardinal
  direction from the current location, and the associated next waypoint will be
  N units of distance in the direction C from this landmark.
  
There will only be one map and associated set of instructions per input file.
